# -bounded-buffer-problem
 bounded buffer problem between a producer and a consumer. The producer will  produce forever and the consumer will consume forever. The producer will put data  into the buffer and the consumer will remove data from the buffer. The buffer must  implement a means of ensuring that the buffer never enters an under flow
In this assignment, you will write a Java program that implements the solution to 
the bounded buffer problem between a producer and a consumer. The producer will 
produce forever and the consumer will consume forever. The producer will put data 
into the buffer and the consumer will remove data from the buffer. The buffer must 
implement a means of ensuring that the buffer never enters an under flow (take too 
much data out) or over flow put too much data into the buffer. Additionally the 
buffer must have functionality so that a critical region problem does not occur with 
parallel updates to the data.
